\section{RESEARCH TITLE}
AN ANDROID PHONE APP FOR REDUCING PAPER WORK BY KEEPING TRACK OF PATIENT HISTORY IN ANDROID PHONES\\ FOR NEW LIFE HOSPITAL,MBALE 

\section{abstract}

Smart phones are now ubiquitous. The most popular operating system these days is Android. It’s easy to use and affordable to all classes.\\ We can find a lot of applications coming up for android based phones. Games, Security, etc App are available for these phones these days.\\ PATIENT HISTORY TRACKER is an android application. This application will store all the emergency call numbers like Hospital, personal doctor’s number etc. Patient does not need to carry the files of previously held check up. This application provides a log-in for doctor and patient as well. Doctor can access the medical diagnose information of the patient.\\ Patient is registered with a unique ID. So the database of history of a patient is available with all the doctors registered with the application.\\ Patient can view their medical diagnose by logging onto their accounts. When travelling or getting treatment from a new doctor then doctor can easily get the patient’s medical history through this application.\\ Patient can save appointments with Doctor’s and medicine reminders. As per pre-diagnosed diseases, a list of Do’s and Don’ts will be attached to the patients profile. \\These will ease the tedious work of handling all the papers and files of hospitals.\\ It will analyze for common disease being found in most patient and number of people affected. It will provide Medical reports that will be digitized and it will be easy to be handled by one.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{background}
  "Patient history tracker system" is being developed to assist a patient and doctor can register, view the medical record anywhere, anytime .\\Also reduce the overhead of handling files every time.\\ The main idea of this application is doctor can find the number of people affected by particular disease, anyone can view health tip, Medical record is available all time.\\ This is an innovative application for patient and doctor acceptance that will provide comfort, convenience and efficiency in everyday life. 
\subsection{Motivation:}
 Bringing down health care costs but also facilitate automating patient identification processes in hospitals and use of PDA’s, Smart phones, for design of health care management system . 
\section{Problem Statement:}
There are large number of commercial system applications to allow a single organization to maintain their data related to patient visiting their Hospital for treatment.\\ Basic problems with the existing system are non-interactive environment they provide to users.\\ Use of such system is only beneficial to a single organization.\\ The existing system does not allow Doctor's to find the disease viral and number of people affected.\\ Existing System doesn't record the details of all users.\\ It is heavy to carry all the files (i.e reports and prescription). 
\subsubsection{Goals and Objectives:}
\subsubsection{Goals:}
 To eliminate the burden of carrying medical files including reports and prescription.\\To save time of managing all the tasks for searching reports which are in paper format.\\ To provide user friendly efficient service to all users.\\ To provide reminders for medicine consumptions. 
\subsubsection{Objectives:}
